This project contains an assortment of 2D and 3D pseudo-realistic fluid simulations. 

Current Scenes/Features:

ShaderSim: Was originally based off the videos SebLague published to YouTube but has been heavily modified
- Contains a 2D and 3D sim you can switch between in the hiearchy
- Currently a little broken
- You can customize particle gradient, where colors are the strongest, how many different groups of two predominant colors
- The simulation can pulse a bit

GameObjectSim: Messing around
- It is not currently "fluid"- right now it spawns particles
- Contains a 2D and 3D sim you can switch between in the hiearchy
- Particle color is based on percentage of the way between it and the next closest zone of the other dominant color
- If it is in a zone, it will be a different color

Eventual plans for this project:
- Modeling Non-Newtonian fluids
- Obstacle detection
- Optimization
- Potentially adding another method of fluid sim
- Finishing the TODO lists in each script
